    "text": "Daniel Hemric is many things, he’s a husband, a father of two, an advocate for cancer research, an amateaur golfer, and he could do a back flip off of his racecar. He’s also a Nascar champion. Hemric has had a successful career, he a track champion at Concord speedway, a place frequented by legends like Dale Earnhardt sr. in the track’s heyday. He amassed 60 wins in legends cars before moving up to modifieds where he won another eight races and a championship. He then got his first chance in Nascar competition in 2015 driving for NTS Motorsports in the truck series. In 2017 he moved up to the Xfinity series driving for Richard Childress racing, legendary Nascar owner who won six Cup series championships with Dale Earnhardt, who Hemric shares a hometown with. He competed for, but fell short of the Xfinity series rookie of the year title finishing fourth in the overall standings. He then got the opportunity to drive for Richard Childress in the Nascar cup series where he did win rookie of the year honors. Despite this he didn’t return the next year and signed with Jr. Motorsports, another one of the Xfinity series’ elite teams in 2021 he signed with Joe Gibbs Racing, where he won the Xfinity series championship. But throughout all of this, Hemric has been hiding a nasty secret. Despite finishing top five in the overall standing for the Xfinity series, and being rookie of the year in the Cup series, and having the fourth most top ten race finishes since 2017 when he entered the series, and leading tons of laps and having good finishes, only one of those has only resulted in a race win. That one win came at the very last race of his championship campaign. After years of rejection and struggle, Hemric overcame the stigma and finally got to do that back flip in Nascar competition. Looking at his career statistics will show that Hemric is simultaneously one of Nascar’s greatest overachievers, and underachievers\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nTopTenFinishes &lt;- read_csv(\"XfinityTopTenData.csv\")\n\nHemric &lt;- TopTenFinishes |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Driver == \"Daniel Hemric\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n geom_bar(data=TopTenFinishes, aes(x=reorder(Driver , TopTenFinishes), weight= TopTenFinishes)) + \n  geom_bar(data=Hemric, aes(x=reorder(Driver, TopTenFinishes), weight= TopTenFinishes), fill=\"#E35335\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Driver\", \n    y=\"Top Ten Finishes\", \n    title=\"Top ten Finishes in the Nascar Xfinity Series since 2017\", \n    subtitle=\"Top ten finishes in the xfinity series since Nascar limited lower series starts for cup series drivers\", \n    caption=\"Source: Racing-Reference.com | By Emanuel Casillas\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nracedata &lt;- c(\"Austin Cindric\" = 115, \"Daniel Hemric\" = 67, \"A.J Allmendinger\"=42, \"Justin Allgaier\"=47, \"Noah Gragson\" = 36)  \nwaffle(         racedata,          rows = 10,          colors = c(\"#FDFD96\", \"black\", \"#77DD77\", \"#FF6961\", \"#AEC6CF\") ) +   labs(     x = \"1 square = 10 laps led\",     title=\"Laps led during the 2021 Xfinity season? \",      subtitle=\"To win races, you have to be at the front, who did that the most in the 2021 season\",     caption=\"Source: Racing-Reference.com | Graphic by Emanuel Casillas\") +      theme_minimal()+   theme(     plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),     axis.title = element_text(size = 10),     axis.title.y = element_blank()   )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplaces &lt;- read_csv(\"xfinity2021results2.csv\")\n\nplaces_long &lt;-places |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols=-Driver, names_to = \"Race\", values_to = \"Place\") |&gt; \n  mutate_at(2:3, as.numeric)\n\nchampfour &lt;- places_long |&gt; \n filter( \n    Driver == \"Daniel Hemric\" | \n    Driver == \"Austin Cindric\" |\n    Driver == \"Noah Gragson\" |\n    Driver == \"A.J Allmendinger\"\n ) \n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bump(data=champfour, aes(x=Race, y=Place, color=Driver))+\n  geom_point(data=champfour, aes(x=Race, y=Place, color=Driver))+\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 26) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#003831\", \"#FEEF01\", \"#E35335\", \"#008456\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse()+\n  facet_wrap(~Driver)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Race\", \n    y=\"Finishing position\", \n    title=\"Finishing positions during the 2021 season\", \n    subtitle=\"Daniel Hemric was alway close, but never got to the top till the very end\", \n    caption=\"Source: Racing-Reference.com | By Emanuel Casillas\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )"
