    "section": "",
    "text": "Daniel Hemric is many things, he’s a husband, a father of two, an advocate for cancer research, an amateaur golfer, and he could do a back flip off of his racecar. He’s also a Nascar champion. Hemric has had a successful career, he is a track champion at Concord speedway, a place frequented by legends like Dale Earnhardt sr. in the track’s heyday. He amassed 60 wins in legends cars before moving up to modifieds where he won another eight races and a championship. He then got his first chance in Nascar competition in 2015 driving for NTS Motorsports in the truck series. In 2017 he moved up to the Xfinity series driving for Richard Childress racing, legendary Nascar owner who won six Cup series championships with Dale Earnhardt, and who Hemric shares a hometown with. He competed for, but fell short of the Xfinity series rookie of the year title finishing fourth in the overall standings. He then got the opportunity to drive for Richard Childress in the Nascar cup series where he won rookie of the year honors. Despite this he didn’t return the next year and signed with Jr. Motorsports, another one of the Xfinity series’ elite teams in 2021 he signed with Joe Gibbs Racing, where he won the Xfinity series championship. But throughout all of this, Hemric has been hiding a nasty secret.\nThe secret isn’t that he’s secretly untalented, Hemric has been a model of consistency. Hemric is one of the best types of drivers in all of racing, the safe kind, he will bring the car home with good results and as undamaged as a race car can be after running a race. Hemric’s rookie year in the xfinity series coincides with Nascar implementing a rule that limited the amount of races drivers from the Cup series could partake in, and since then he has the fourth most top ten finishes in the series. There’s only a handful of other drivers who call the xfinity series home who bring the car home in the top ten as much as he has, so he is a good driver. \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nTopTenFinishes &lt;- read_csv(\"XfinityTopTenData.csv\")\n\nHemric &lt;- TopTenFinishes |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Driver == \"Daniel Hemric\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n geom_bar(data=TopTenFinishes, aes(x=reorder(Driver , TopTenFinishes), weight= TopTenFinishes)) + \n  geom_bar(data=Hemric, aes(x=reorder(Driver, TopTenFinishes), weight= TopTenFinishes), fill=\"#E35335\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Driver\", \n    y=\"Top Ten Finishes\", \n    title=\"Top 10 Finishes in the Nascar Xfinity Series since 2017\", \n    subtitle=\"Top 10's for full-time xfinity drivers\", \n    caption=\"Source: Racing-Reference.com | By Emanuel Casillas\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get to the bottom of this secret, it is important to look at that 2021 championship season. What is something conducive to success in racing? Being at the front of field of cars, and Hemric did just that, he certainly did not skate by with a few lucky finishes, he was consistently at the front, each of the other drivers in his ball park were multiple time winners this season.\n\n\nCode\nracedata &lt;- c(\"Austin Cindric\" = 115, \"Daniel Hemric\" = 67, \"A.J Allmendinger\"=42, \"Justin Allgaier\"=47, \"Noah Gragson\" = 36)  \nwaffle(         racedata,          rows = 10,          colors = c(\"#FDFD96\", \"black\", \"#77DD77\", \"#FF6961\", \"#AEC6CF\") ) +   labs(     x = \"1 square = 10 laps led\",     title=\"Laps led during the 2021 Xfinity season? \",      subtitle=\"To win races, you have to be at the front, who did that the most in the 2021 season?\",     caption=\"Source: Racing-Reference.com | Graphic by Emanuel Casillas\") +      theme_minimal()+   theme(     plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),     axis.title = element_text(size = 10),     axis.title.y = element_blank()   )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, the only thing that matters is where a driver is on the last lap. That is where the truth will be found, and that’s Hemric’s secret. Hemric won one race in his championship campaign, not only was it his first win on the season, but his first ever win across all Nascar series, and he did it in the very last race. \n\n\nCode\nplaces &lt;- read_csv(\"xfinity2021results2.csv\")\n\nplaces_long &lt;-places |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols=-Driver, names_to = \"Race\", values_to = \"Place\") |&gt; \n  mutate_at(2:3, as.numeric)\n\nchampfour &lt;- places_long |&gt; \n filter( \n    Driver == \"Daniel Hemric\" | \n    Driver == \"Austin Cindric\" |\n    Driver == \"Noah Gragson\" |\n    Driver == \"A.J Allmendinger\"\n ) \n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bump(data=champfour, aes(x=Race, y=Place, color=Driver))+\n  geom_point(data=champfour, aes(x=Race, y=Place, color=Driver))+\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 26) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#003831\", \"#FEEF01\", \"#E35335\", \"#008456\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse()+\n  facet_wrap(~Driver)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Race\", \n    y=\"Finishing position\", \n    title=\"Finishing positions during the 2021 season\", \n    subtitle=\"Daniel Hemric was always close.

    "section": "",
    "text": "IndyCar racing is old, American open-wheel racing has existed since at least 1906, that is about 45 years before Nascar and Formula one existed. The term ‘IndyCar’ was coined in 1911 when Ray Haroun won the first Indianapolis 500, so there’s tons of history in American open-wheel racing. Their marquee event is the second-most attended annual gathering of humans, and some of the most talented drivers in history have made a name in their names racing Indycars. The series has a combination of oval tracks, road courses, and street tracks. There is lots to like about the series. It would be easy to assume that Indy racing is one of the most popular racing series in the world, but it’s not, in the United States it is behind both Nascar and Formula one in terms of popularity. The reason for this is a twelve year civil war that fractured American open-wheel racing and is the most important event in motorsports history. A domino effect starting with Formula one legend Jim Clark winning the Indianapolis 500 in 1966 led to the first split, where the United States Auto Club (USAC) relinquished control of the series to the Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART), a board of team owners with the exception of the Indianapolis 500. The feud started back up again in the early 90s where Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George wanted track owners to have a greater say in how the series is run, and in the ensuing feud started his own series to rival CART, the Indy Racing League (IRL). American open-wheel racing remained fractured for 12 years, and the 2008 reunification season was hampered by the economic recession. Recovery has been slow ever since, and the story of the IndyCar split can be told through the speed of the cars themselves. The IRL branded themselves as the down home simple series where the schedule was all ovals and the drivers earned their seat by rising through the ranks of midget cars, sprint cars to IndyCars. CART had the more famous drivers who oftentimes were siphoned from the European ladder to Formula one, there were fast cars, and big money sponsors. \nLooking at the so-called greatest spectacle in racing, the speeds climbed heavily through the CART days, and through the first split year were reaching new highs. In 1996 Arie Luyendyk set a four lap average of 236.986 mph which remains a record to its day, and a single lap average of 237.498 mph. Luyendyk sat on pole for the 1997 Indy500 also, but along with day’s long rain showers affecting condition, the new IRL engine and chassis brought the pole speed down to 218.263 mph.\nIn the ensuing years the 10 mile average for Indy500 qualifying steadily rose, but never reached the heights of the pre-split days. Pole speed at the 500 only started regularly breaking 230 mph averages around 2014, and the pole record was broken in 2024 by Scott McLaughlin at 234.220 mph. \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nIndyPoles &lt;- read_csv(\"Indy 500 pole data.csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=IndyPoles, \n    aes(y=Year, x=SlowestSpeed, xend=FastestSpeed),\n  size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\")+\n    labs(\n      x=\"Average Speed\",\n      y=\"\",\n    title=\"The greatest spectacle in racing \", \n    subtitle = \"&lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;Pole positions&lt;/span&gt; are on the right. &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;Slowest qualifiers&lt;/span&gt; are on the left.\", \n     caption=\"Source: Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museaum | By Emanuel Casillas\"\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, CART’s approach to the split was to reach new heights, the turbocharged engines and higher downforce allowed for greater speed, one of their great showcases of speed was the 2000 Marlboro 500 at the California speedway. The two-mile high banked oval allowed for insane average finishes, including pole-winner Gil de Ferran driving for Team Penske breaking the closed course speed record with an average speed of 241.___ mph, and unofficially, Chip Ganassi Racing Driver Juan Pablo Montoya went even faster at 242.___ during practice. Although speed peaked at California, the similarly configured Michigan International speedway saw similar speeds with Paul Tracy setting the pole speed at 234.___ mph. \n\n\nCode\nfontana &lt;- read_csv(\"Fontana speed.csv\")\njpm &lt;- fontana |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Driver == \"Juan Montoya\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Difference = PracticeSpeed - QualifyingSpeed \n  ) |&gt;\n  select(Driver, QualifyingSpeed, Difference) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=c(-Driver), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Speed\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = fontana, aes(x=reorder(Driver, QualifyingSpeed), weight=QualifyingSpeed),fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data= jpm, aes(x=Driver, weight=Speed, fill=Type)) +\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Speed\", \n    title=\"California Dreamin'\", \n    subtitle=\"The 2000 CART race at Fontana was one of the fastest weekends in motorsports.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Indycar Communications | By Emanuel Casillas\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()+\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\")\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe arms race in CART culminated at the Texas motor speedway (TMS), although the track was shorter and not as steeply banked as California or Michigan, the increasing downforce and power allowed the cars to reach nearly the same speeds around turns of a significantly smaller radius. \nThe trouble started long before the race itself, CART board advisor Wally Dallenbach visited the track while it was under construction and deemed the track unfit for CART. CART and TMS did not sign the contract to race at the track until August of 2000 leaving little time for negotiation and changes. Eddie Gossage, president of TMS reluctantly had changes made to the track at CART’s request and made his wishes known that CART hold a test at the track prior to racing there for safety and marketing reasons. \nGossage also stated that for a race to be held at the track in a safe manner, CART should slow their cars down to the speeds their IRL counterparts were racing at which was the 225 mph average range. No such test ever happened, only two private tests were held, Team Rahal driver Kenny Brack did a day of testing in December, and CART driver union president Marucio Gugelmin and his team PacWest racing did their own test in February, both days were unable to simulate race day conditions due to factors like temperature and wind. \n\n\nCode\ntexas &lt;- read_csv(\"Indycar texas data.csv\")\ntexas |&gt; \ngt() |&gt; \n   cols_label(\n    LapTime = \"Lap Time\",\n    SpeedMph = \"Speed (MPH)\", \n    SpeedKph = \"Speed (KPH)\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Blinding speed\",\n    subtitle = \"The speed of the 2001 Firestone Firehawk 600 was making drivers pass out.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Emanuel Casillas  |  **Source:** IndyCar Communications\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlinding speed\n\n\nThe speed of the 2001 Firestone Firehawk 600 was making drivers pass out.\n\n\nPos\nDriver\nCar\nLap Time\nSpeed (MPH)\nSpeed (KPH)\n\n\n\n\n1\nTony Kanaan\n55\n22.845\n233.539\n375.834\n\n\n2\nChristian Fittipaldi\n11\n23.001\n231.955\n373.285\n\n\n3\nHelio Castroneves\n3\n23.003\n231.935\n373.253\n\n\n4\nCristiano da Matta\n6\n23.033\n231.633\n372.767\n\n\n5\nGil de Ferran\n1\n23.035\n231.613\n372.734\n\n\n6\nKenny Brack\n8\n23.056\n231.402\n372.395\n\n\n7\nBryan Herta\n77\n23.069\n231.271\n372.185\n\n\n8\nPaul Tracy\n26\n23.119\n230.771\n371.380\n\n\n9\nMax Papis\n7\n23.126\n230.701\n371.268\n\n\n10\nAlex Zanardi\n66X\n23.165\n230.313\n370.643\n\n\n11\nDario Franchitti\n27\n23.229\n229.678\n369.621\n\n\n12\nPatrick Carpentier\n32\n23.289\n229.087\n368.669\n\n\n13\nCristiano da Matta\n6X\n23.321\n228.772\n368.163\n\n\n14\nBruno Junqueira (R)\n4\n23.323\n228.753\n368.132\n\n\n15\nAlex Tagliani\n33\n23.323\n228.753\n368.132\n\n\n16\nOriol Servia\n22\n23.332\n228.664\n367.990\n\n\n17\nMichael Andretti\n39\n23.346\n228.527\n367.769\n\n\n18\nJimmy Vasser\n40\n23.358\n228.410\n367.580\n\n\n19\nRoberto Moreno\n20\n23.361\n228.381\n367.533\n\n\n20\nScott Dixon (R)\n18\n23.377\n228.224\n367.281\n\n\n21\nNicolas Minassian (R)\n12\n23.382\n228.176\n367.203\n\n\n22\nMauricio Gugelmin\n17\n23.386\n228.136\n367.140\n\n\n23\nKenny Brack\n8X\n23.395\n228.049\n366.999\n\n\n24\nShinji Nakano\n52\n23.41\n227.903\n366.764\n\n\n25\nAlex Zanardi\n66\n23.495\n227.078\n365.437\n\n\n26\nToranosuke Takagi (R)\n5\n23.593\n226.135\n363.919\n\n\n27\nAdrian Fernandez\n51\n23.631\n225.771\n363.334\n\n\n28\nJimmy Vasser\n40X\n23.634\n225.743\n363.288\n\n\n29\nNicolas Minassian (R)\n12X\n23.684\n225.266\n362.521\n\n\n30\nPatrick Carpentier\n32X\n23.702\n225.095\n362.245\n\n\n31\nMax Papis\n7X\n23.768\n224.470\n361.239\n\n\n32\nMichael Andretti\n39X\n23.792\n224.243\n360.875\n\n\n33\nBruno Junqueira (R)\n4X\n23.81\n224.074\n360.602\n\n\n34\nScott Dixon (R)\n18X\n23.873\n223.483\n359.651\n\n\n35\nDario Franchitti\n27X\n23.9\n223.230\n359.244\n\n\n36\nToranosuke Takagi (R)\n5X\n24.029\n222.032\n357.316\n\n\n37\nMax Wilson (R)\n25\n24.065\n221.700\n356.781\n\n\n38\nMichel Jourdain Jr.\n16X\n24.109\n221.295\n356.130\n\n\n39\nMauricio Gugelmin\n17X\n24.231\n220.181\n354.337\n\n\n40\nPaul Tracy\n26X\n24.338\n219.213\n352.779\n\n\n41\nBryan Herta\n77X\n24.451\n218.200\n351.149\n\n\n42\nTony Kanaan\n55X\n24.859\n214.618\n345.385\n\n\n43\nRoberto Moreno\n20X\n25.267*\n211.153\n339.808\n\n\n44\nShinji Nakano\n52X\n25.656*\n207.951\n334.656\n\n\n45\nMichel Jourdain Jr.\n16\n25.838*\n206.487\n332.299\n\n\n46\nChristian Fittipaldi\n11X\n26.200*\n203.634\n327.708\n\n\n47\nGil de Ferran\n1X\n26.314*\n202.751\n326.288\n\n\n48\nOriol Servia\n22X\n26.611*\n200.489\n322.646\n\n\n49\nAdrian Fernandez\n51X\n26.705*\n199.783\n321.510\n\n\n\nBy: Emanuel Casillas | Source: IndyCar Communications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce race day was closer, the concerns that were once in the background came to the forefront as speed grew, drivers were setting average lap speeds well above 230 mph, Max Papis stated that he was going so fast that when his tim told him to pit he didn’t because he couldn’t differentiate the front stretch and back stretch. Several more drivers reported dizziness and nausea, spotters said that merely watching the cars was dizzying. \nCART and TMS realized something had to be done and multiple solutions were proposed, as much downforce and horsepower had been trimmed from the cars as possible. Talk of using the infield road course and adding a set of cones to the back straightaway were entertained as ways of slowing the cars down, but ultimately the race was canceled, the only race in CART history to be canceled without postponement. \nEventually CART moved away from the large ovals, and the board filed for bankruptcy two years later rebranding as the Champ Car World Series, which filed for bankruptcy itself after the 2007 season, it’s assets were bought by the IRL which had since rebranded to the IndyCar series and the two became whole in 2008, although th remnants of the IndyCar civil war remain ever present."
