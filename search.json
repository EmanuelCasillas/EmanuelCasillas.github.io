    "section": "",
    "text": "Daniel Hemric is many things, he’s a husband, a father of two, an advocate for cancer research, an amateaur golfer, and he could do a back flip off of his racecar. He’s also a Nascar champion. Hemric has had a successful career, he is a track champion at Concord speedway, a place frequented by legends like Dale Earnhardt sr. in the track’s heyday. He amassed 60 wins in legends cars before moving up to modifieds where he won another eight races and a championship. He then got his first chance in Nascar competition in 2015 driving for NTS Motorsports in the truck series. In 2017 he moved up to the Xfinity series driving for Richard Childress racing, legendary Nascar owner who won six Cup series championships with Dale Earnhardt, and who Hemric shares a hometown with. He competed for, but fell short of the Xfinity series rookie of the year title finishing fourth in the overall standings. He then got the opportunity to drive for Richard Childress in the Nascar cup series where he won rookie of the year honors. Despite this he didn’t return the next year and signed with Jr. Motorsports, another one of the Xfinity series’ elite teams in 2021 he signed with Joe Gibbs Racing, where he won the Xfinity series championship. But throughout all of this, Hemric has been hiding a nasty secret.\nThe secret isn’t that he’s secretly untalented, Hemric has been a model of consistency. Hemric is one of the best types of drivers in all of racing, the safe kind, he will bring the car home with good results and as undamaged as a race car can be after running a race. Hemric’s rookie year in the xfinity series coincides with Nascar implementing a rule that limited the amount of races drivers from the Cup series could partake in, and since then he has the fourth most top ten finishes in the series. There’s only a handful of other drivers who call the xfinity series home who bring the car home in the top ten as much as he has, so he is a good driver. \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nTopTenFinishes &lt;- read_csv(\"XfinityTopTenData.csv\")\n\nHemric &lt;- TopTenFinishes |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Driver == \"Daniel Hemric\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n geom_bar(data=TopTenFinishes, aes(x=reorder(Driver , TopTenFinishes), weight= TopTenFinishes)) + \n  geom_bar(data=Hemric, aes(x=reorder(Driver, TopTenFinishes), weight= TopTenFinishes), fill=\"#E35335\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Driver\", \n    y=\"Top Ten Finishes\", \n    title=\"Top ten Finishes in the Nascar Xfinity Series since 2017\", \n    subtitle=\"Top ten finishes in the xfinity series since Nascar limited lower series starts for cup series drivers\", \n    caption=\"Source: Racing-Reference.com | By Emanuel Casillas\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get to the bottom of this secret, it is important to look at that 2021 championship season. What is something conducive to success in racing? Being at the front of field of cars, and Hemric did just that, he certainly did not skate by with a few lucky finishes, he was consistently at the front, each of the other drivers in his ball park were multiple time winners this season.\n\n\nCode\nracedata &lt;- c(\"Austin Cindric\" = 115, \"Daniel Hemric\" = 67, \"A.J Allmendinger\"=42, \"Justin Allgaier\"=47, \"Noah Gragson\" = 36)  \nwaffle(         racedata,          rows = 10,          colors = c(\"#FDFD96\", \"black\", \"#77DD77\", \"#FF6961\", \"#AEC6CF\") ) +   labs(     x = \"1 square = 10 laps led\",     title=\"Laps led during the 2021 Xfinity season? \",      subtitle=\"To win races, you have to be at the front, who did that the most in the 2021 season\",     caption=\"Source: Racing-Reference.com | Graphic by Emanuel Casillas\") +      theme_minimal()+   theme(     plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),     axis.title = element_text(size = 10),     axis.title.y = element_blank()   )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, the only thing that matters is where a driver is on the last lap. That is where the truth will be found, and that’s Hemric’s secret. Hemric won one race in his championship campaign, not only was it his first win on the season, but his first ever win across all Nascar series, and he did it in the very last race. \n\n\nCode\nplaces &lt;- read_csv(\"xfinity2021results2.csv\")\n\nplaces_long &lt;-places |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols=-Driver, names_to = \"Race\", values_to = \"Place\") |&gt; \n  mutate_at(2:3, as.numeric)\n\nchampfour &lt;- places_long |&gt; \n filter( \n    Driver == \"Daniel Hemric\" | \n    Driver == \"Austin Cindric\" |\n    Driver == \"Noah Gragson\" |\n    Driver == \"A.J Allmendinger\"\n ) \n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bump(data=champfour, aes(x=Race, y=Place, color=Driver))+\n  geom_point(data=champfour, aes(x=Race, y=Place, color=Driver))+\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 26) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#003831\", \"#FEEF01\", \"#E35335\", \"#008456\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse()+\n  facet_wrap(~Driver)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Race\", \n    y=\"Finishing position\", \n    title=\"Finishing positions during the 2021 season\", \n    subtitle=\"Daniel Hemric was always close. X intercept is the playoffs\", \n    caption=\"Source: Racing-Reference.com | By Emanuel Casillas\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Hemric finally got his second Nascar win earlier this year in the Truck series and finally got a second Backflip in Nascar competition."
