    "text": "Daniel Hemric is many things, he’s a husband, a father of two, an advocate for cancer research, an amateaur golfer, and he could do a backflip. He’s also a Nascar champion. Hemric has had a successful career, he a track champion at Concord speedway, a place frequented by legends like Dale Earnhardt sr. in the track’s heyday. He amassed 60 wins in legends cars before moving up to modifieds where he won another eight races and a championship. He then got a chance in the Nascar truck series in 2015 driving the NTS Motorsports 14 truck. In 2017 he moved up to the Xfinity series driving for Richard Childress racing, legendary Nascar owner who won six Cup series championships with Dale Earnhardt, who Hemric shares a hometown with. He competed for, but fell short of the Xfinity series rookie of the year title finishing fourth in the overall standings. He then got the opportunity to drive for Richard Childress in the Nascar cup series where he did win rookie of the year honors. Despite this he didn’t return the next year and signed with Jr. motorsports In 2021 he signed with Joe Gibbs racing and in his first season with the team won the Xfinity series championship. But throughout all of this, there’s been a dirty secret Hemric has been hiding. He only has one career Nascar win amongst the three top tier series, Trucks, Xfinity and Cup. Looking at his career statistics will show that Hemric is simultaneously one of Nascar’s greatest overachievers, and underachievers\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nTopTenFinishes &lt;- read_csv(\"XfinityTopTenData.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 10 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): Driver\ndbl (2): Rank, TopTenFinishes\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nHemric &lt;- TopTenFinishes |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Driver == \"Daniel Hemric\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n geom_bar(data=TopTenFinishes, aes(x=reorder(Driver , TopTenFinishes), weight= TopTenFinishes)) + \n  geom_bar(data=Hemric, aes(x=reorder(Driver, TopTenFinishes), weight= TopTenFinishes), fill=\"#E35335\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Driver\", \n    y=\"Top Ten Finishes\", \n    title=\"Top ten Finishes in the Nascar Xfinity Series since 2017\", \n    subtitle=\"Top ten finishes in the xfinity series since Nascar limited lower series starts for cup series drivers\", \n    caption=\"Source: Racing-Reference.com | By Emanuel Casillas\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nracedata &lt;- c(\"Austin Cindric\" = 115, \"Daniel Hemric\" = 67, \"A.J Allmendinger\"=42, \"Justin Allgaier\"=47, \"Noah Gragson\" = 36)  \nwaffle(         racedata,          rows = 10,          colors = c(\"#FDFD96\", \"black\", \"#77DD77\", \"#FF6961\", \"#AEC6CF\") ) +   labs(     x = \"1 square = 10 laps led\",     title=\"Laps led during the 2021 Xfinity season? \",      subtitle=\"To win races, you have to be at the front, who did that the most in the 2021 season\",     caption=\"Source: Racing-Reference.com | Graphic by Emanuel Casillas\") +      theme_minimal()+   theme(     plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),     axis.title = element_text(size = 10),     axis.title.y = element_blank()   )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplaces &lt;- read_csv(\"xfinity2021results2.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 12 Columns: 34\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (1): Driver\ndbl (33): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nplaces_long &lt;-places |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols=-Driver, names_to = \"Race\", values_to = \"Place\") |&gt; \n  mutate_at(2:3, as.numeric)\nhead(places_long)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Driver         Race Place\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Daniel Hemric     1     9\n2 Daniel Hemric     2     3\n3 Daniel Hemric     3     3\n4 Daniel Hemric     4     2\n5 Daniel Hemric     5    23\n6 Daniel Hemric     6     9\n\n\nCode\nchampfour &lt;- places_long |&gt; \n filter( \n    Driver == \"Daniel Hemric\" | \n    Driver == \"Austin Cindric\" |\n    Driver == \"Noah Gragson\" |\n    Driver == \"A.J Allmendinger\"\n ) \n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bump(data=champfour, aes(x=Race, y=Place, color=Driver))+\n  geom_point(data=champfour, aes(x=Race, y=Place, color=Driver))+\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 26) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#003831\", \"#FEEF01\", \"#E35335\", \"#008456\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse()+\n  facet_wrap(~Driver)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Race\", \n    y=\"Finishing position\", \n    title=\"Finishing positions during the 2021 season\", \n    subtitle=\"Daniel Hemric was alway close, but never got to the top till the very end\", \n    caption=\"Source: Racing-Reference.com | By Emanuel Casillas\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )"
